Prompt: Design a Scalable Multi-Channel Campaign Management Platform

We are looking to conceptualize and implement a robust, enterprise-grade Multi-Channel Campaign Management System designed to streamline communication across SMS, VOIP, WhatsApp, and RCS. The system should support real-time, automated, and two-way interactions with rich personalization and analytics capabilities. The solution must be modular, multi-tenant, API-first, and secure.
